This repository contains the code for a "human-like" Sudoku solver. This is a fun project of mine that I have been live streaming every weekend.

The main idea is to create a solver that implements human-style Sudoku solving techniques and is able to judge puzzle difficulty from that.

Ultimately I want to use this solver to generate some fun Sudoku variant puzzles.

If you have any questions about the code, join me for one of the streams, every Sat&Sun 14:30 CE(S)T at https://www.youtube.com/user/HappyCerberus

You can also hit me up on my Discord server (https://discord.gg/qTAZkd), or here on Github.
